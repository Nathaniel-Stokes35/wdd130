			<p>My name is <b>Nathaniel Stokes</b>, <br>
			I have a lot of experience working with computer languages <br>
			but the last time I actually had a class involving <br>
			the subject was when I was in my junior year of high school. <br>
			So it feels refreashing to actually move forward, <br>
			<i>academically</i>, towards a personal passion and hobby of mine. <br>
			I am very familiar with/know: Java, HTML, Python, C++, C#, SQL, and VBA.<br>
			I have three children, Jonah, Pearl, and Henry who is in the picture. <br>
			They are 5, 3, and 1.5 as of the construction of this page (11/4/2024) <br>
			<br>I'm looking forward to progressing and becoming the man God has planned for me and my family.</p>
