                            <h3>A Love for Technology</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>&emsp;My grandfather worked as a quality inspector at IBM for much of his career. Whether it was because of that, or my upbringing in a home with just my brother and mom, I've always had a strong affinity for technology and computers. When I was in second grade, my mother enrolled me 
                        in a Duke University talent search program, where I took that year's SAT to see how I would perform. This stemmed from an IQ test I took at school because of a speech impediment where I slurred my R's. I remember the excitement and nervousness of learning that I was eligible for those 
                        advanced summer programs. In my junior year of high school, I was introduced to my first real programming language: Java. Although I couldn't attend the final program due to financial struggles, My friend Cameron and I spent days building a Final Fantasy-esque RPG. While our forget the 
                        grade didn't rely on it, we were motivated simply by the excitement of coding. I focused on the mechanics, systems, inventory, and story, while Cameron worked on the graphics. I'll never anxiety of trying to get our code to work together, but after I started experimenting with C#, learned 
                        some persistence, we managed to get the game finished and played it with friends I've always loved the logic and mystery behind codingâ€”fundamentally, at the lunch table on my old laptop. After learning Java, C++, and during my senior year, I took a web development course, where I became 
                        familiar with HTML and CSS. it's all about exploration and problem-solving. It's a passion that has pushed me to grow, especially in areas where I've needed to strengthen myself, like managing my ADD.

                            <h3>Early Growth and Discovery</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>&emsp;I've always been social, I'm an extrovert to my core. Out of highschool I was afraid to turn my hobby into a career, assuming I would end up just hating my hobby and regretting the whole thing, but life has a tendency to guide you where you need to be. 
                        After highschool I wanted to combine my social extrovert natures into an analytical, positive, financially stable, career; so I went to Ozark Technical Community collage to pursue a degree in psychology. School was challenging when I was growing up, I had ADD and 
                        school never interested me. I graduated simply because of my test taking skills and the generosity of the public school system, I never did homework and I never studied. So a community collage was about the best I could do and I only succeeded at the classes I was 
                        interested in. I loved psychology, I scoured through the DSM-5 learning about the different ways a mind can manifest and it really interested me but I saw in myself the lack of discipline and control I would need to do well in this world. So, after moving in with my 
                        grandmother to "house-sit" while they went on a trip to Jerusalem, I decided to enlist in the airforce, with the idea being I would serve 10 years active, 10 years reserve while I was finishing my degree, then I would retire the military around 38, collect a pension while 
                        starting a career as a post-secondary psychology instructor. Age 65 I would retire on two pensions and enjoy my golden years with whatever civilian life I was able to pull together.</p>

                            <h3>The Accident and Recovery</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>&emsp;March 7th, 2015: I was about a week off from being shipped to Louisiana to start bootcamp and training to become a cyber security specialist, if I couldn't weasle my way into becoming an SERE insturctor which was the actual MOS I wanted, for the united states airforce.
                        I was heading home from a friend's D&D game where my paladin was killed when I was T-Boned by oncoming traffic. My brain did a summersault inside my skull and when I woke up in the hospital I had reverted to a infant, mentally. I was 20 years old, engaged to a girl in Montana and gearing 
                        up for the rest of my life when this happened. I suffered from a TBI where I spent months recovering in the hospital and years recovering at home. I had no broken bones and I was realtively unharmed physically, I heard the joke "you had brains to spare" a million times and it was 
                        always old. The hardest part was knowing who you were and coming to terms with who you are. The military medically discharged me which makes me ineligible to re-enlist, my fiancee left me because it was really difficult and I never made it easy on her. That same year my grandfather passed away and I remember the 
                        difficulty of just trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered world. The very last day of that horrible year, December 31st 2015, was when I met my wife. When I met her I could litterally feel the light of Christ emanating from her and somehow I knew I would be okay if I was with her.</p>

                            <h3>Finding My Future</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>&emsp;I met Daisy in December, we ran off together in March, and April of 2016 I started working as a CAP2 associate at the McDonald County Walmart Supercenter, store 5261. I became very familiar with telezones, hand-held MC-40's, and capitalized on the 5 foot customer rule, evetually I became a
                        Wireless Sales Associate. I specialized in selling the phone packages but I played the photo-lab, electronics, and cashier roles as well. I helped handle phones and electronics with customers on the front-end everyday, one of my favorite memories at walmart was when someone had an issue
                         with the CMOS battary in their all-in-one computer so I was able to tear it apart and just look at the inner workings of the system to remove the battary and give it a reset. Walmart played off my desire to help people, my ability to communicate complicated ideas to laymen, and my innate, extroverted, social skills. I became the stores "Tech-guy" for
                        electronics, sporting goods, baby, fabric, and apparel, I had even been called on my days off to find the issue a couple of times. After a few years I left Wal-Mart to help a church friend in Neosho with his personal business. The Company was called "LS-Grips" and this was the start of
                        my understanding of the logistics towards consumerism. Of course, even though it was a friends personal business, I became the defacto IT guy for the systems and internet presence.</p>

                            <h3>Finding a Career</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>&emsp;Working With Lance, the owner of LS-Grips, I started as a manufacturer of wooden 1911 grips. It's always where people begin because it gets you familiar with the machines and how to approach common problems that may be more expensive in later sets. It was me, Lance, Lance's brother, and the son 
                        of another church friend for the whole operation. We distributed the grips through the United State Postal Service every morning and packaged the materials and information the night before. After I learned 1911's I learned 238 grips but then I became the man in charge of shipping completely. I was 
                        in charge of ensuring all the orders went out on time, the restock was being worked on correctly, the grips that needed stained were ready for Lance to apply lacquer every night, and I was in charge of engraving with the laser. LS-Grips was a good job but this was also when Daisy had our first child 
                        so money became increasingly more scarce. I was told State Farm in Pineville was hiring so I applied there hoping to establish a wage which could support a family. I was studying for the Property and Casualty License when I gave in my two weeks, I had gotten my Life and Health License two days before 
                        my last day.</p>

                            <h3>Professional Growth and Discovery</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>&emsp;State Farm was a completely different animal, I learned more about the community I had been living in for years more in that time than the other years combined. I believed in what I was doing, I believed in helping people understand their rates, understand why the world worked the way it did, helping 
                        families understand the path that could get them where they wanted to be. If after the accident I had restarted my life State Farm would be best described as when I was introduced to the real world, when I truly felt I was coming into my own. Sean taught me many things that are key to being a man. He was a 
                        second father to me in a lot of ways. Of course, at State Farm, just like all of my jobs, I became the defacto IT guy. I was working closely with Zach who was the district software specialist for the area, to get the most out of the resources available to agents and offices. I would help everyone with ECRM 
                        and any changes or updates that were presented. At Lance's I helped write a description page for all of his amazon listings that felt like a real website and online presence and at State Farm I worked with excel to automate commission so it was all easier. I spent hours on both of those projects just for the
                        sake of finishing them, and because I found it challanging and interesting. I spent years at State Farm, working with people, supporting the team and building the community. Daisy and I had two more children in that time and I started to realize State Farm, sales in general, wasn't the career I wanted to pursue 
                        so I left State Farm and started a Data Science Bootcamp with TripleTen. (You can explore the projects I completed for TripleTen <a href="./tripleTen.html">here</a>.) As I explored my options to broaden my understanding, and put pen to paper on this pursuit, I enrolled in a software development bachelors program at BYU-Idaho. You 
                        can find more information about my work there, <a href="./byu-i.html">here</a>. <br>&emsp;I felt a calling and then it became so obvious. I love to code, I've always loved the problem solving, the discovery and I felt so foolish for not realizing it sooner. I've always had a passion for this, it's why I broadcast myself as an 
                        "IT" guy, it's why I've always found excuses to dive deeper, learn new languages, explore a deeper understanding everywhere I went. God is Good and I know this is where I am supposed to be.</p>
