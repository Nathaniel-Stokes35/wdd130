			<p>My name is <b>Nathaniel Stokes</b>, <br>
			I have a lot of experience working with computer languages <br>
			but the last time I actually had a class involving <br>
			the subject was when I was in my junior year of high school. <br>
			So it feels refreashing to actually move forward, <br>
			<i>academically</i>, towards a personal passion and hobby of mine. <br>
			I am very familiar with/know: Java, HTML, Python, C++, C#, SQL, and VBA.<br>
			I have three children, Jonah, Pearl, and Henry who is in the picture. <br>
			They are 5, 3, and 1.5 as of the construction of this page (11/4/2024) <br>
			<br>I'm looking forward to progressing and becoming the man God has planned for me and my family.</p>
			<h4>A list of my favorite Temples</h4>

				<li><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/kansas-city-missouri-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Kansas City Temple</a> of course, This was where I did my own endowlment and where my family was sealed together.</li>
				<li>Then there has to be the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/seattle-washington-temple?lang=eng" target="_blank">Seattle Temple</a>, the area, the grounds, just the raw beauty is breathtaking. A personal friend of mine also got sealed to his wife there and I can't explain how special that is.</li>
