			<p>My name is <b>Nathaniel Stokes</b>, </br>I have a lot of experience working with computer languages </br>but the last time I actually had a class
			involving </br>the subject was when I was in my junior year of high school. </br>So it feels refreashing to actually move forward, </br><i>academically</i>, 
			towards a personal passion and 
			hobby of mine. </br>
			I am very familiar with/know: Java, HTML, Python, C++, C#, and VBA.</br>
			I have three children, Jonah, Pearl, and Henry who is in the picture. </br>They are 5, 3, and 1.5 as of the construction of this page (11/4/2024)
			</br></br>I'm looking forward to progressing and becoming the man God has planned for me and my family.</p>
